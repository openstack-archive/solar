.. _faq_hardcoded_params:

Why nodes/transports have hardcoded keys, ips and other inputs ?
----------------------------------------------------------------

This is temporary situation, we will improve it in near future.

.. _faq_different_ssh_keys:

I want to use different SSH keys
--------------------------------

Just update resource for example::

    solar resource update ssh_transport1 '{"key": "/path/to/some/key"}'

I want to use passwords not keys
--------------------------------

Just update resource::

    solar resource update rsync1 '{"password": "vagrant", "key": null}'

.. note::

   You need to change it for all transport resources (ssh and rsync by default).


How can I run solar worker ?
-----------------------------------

- If you use `vagrant` then you can just `sudo start solar-worker`
  as `vagrant` user.

How can I configure solar ?
---------------------------

There are several places where we search for config values:

1. `.config` file in CWD or in path from `SOLAR_CONFIG` env variable
2. if env `SOLAR_CONFIG_OVERRIDE` contains valid path then it override
   previous values
3. `.config.override` in CWD
4. You can also set upper-cased env variable which matches one of those in
   config

.. _faq_what_database:

What database can I use with solar ?
------------------------------------

By default for simplicity we use `sqlite`. On our vagrant environment we use
single node `riak`.
You can also use multiple nodes `riak`, with some strong consistent buckets.

.. _faq_solar_examples:

Where can I find solar examples ?
---------------------------------

Example resources, composer templates and examples itself are located:
https://github.com/openstack/solar-resources

.. _faq_solar_docker:

Can I run solar nodes with docker ?
-----------------------------------

Yes, although that is an experimental feature and currently supports only
a single network interface per a container. Note, that before to run the
``vagrant up --provider docker`` command, the following preparations must be
done at the host system:

.. code-block:: bash

  # docker pull solarproject/riak

or, depending on the configured DB backend:

.. code-block:: bash

  # git clone https://github.com/kiasaki/docker-alpine-postgres.git
  # cd docker-alpine-postgres
  # make build && cd -

This will allow the solar nodes to run required nested DB containers.

.. note ::
  The command ``vagrant ssh`` will not be working for the docker case.
  Instead, use any of the following commands (with a correct name/IP):

  .. code-block:: bash

    # ssh vagrant@10.0.0.2
    # docker exec -it solar-dev bash

.. note ::
  The command ``vagrant destroy`` only cleans up containers for solar nodes
  and does not clean up other containers launched, like riak, postgres,
  kolla or the like. You should stop and remove them from the host system
  manually!
