Entities
========

Worker
------

Worker encapsulates logic related to certain area in solar.
Current we have next workers:

* Scheduler
  Correctly initates execution plans and updates state of tasks.
* Tasks
  Execute tasks scheduled by Scheduler worker
* System log
  Updates system log e.g. commits and moves log item from staged log
  to history, or in case of error updates log item as erred

Executors
---------

Each executor module should provide:

* Executor
  Executor responsible for processing events and handle them via given
  worker. Concurrency policies is up to the executor implementation.
* Client
  Client communicates with executor

In current version of Solar we are using executor based on Push/Pull
zeromq sockets, and gevent pool for concurrent processing of events.

Subscriptions
-------------

Each public method of worker is subscribable, in current version
4 events are available to subscribers.

* on_sucess
  Called in the case of successful execution, provides context, result
  and event arguments
* on_error
  Called in the case of error, prorives context, error type, event
  arguments
* before
  Called before method execution, provides only context
* after
  Called after method executuon, provides only context

To subscribe use::

    worker.method.on_sucess(callable)

Additionally each worker provides *for_all* descriptor which allows
to subscribe to all public methods::

    worker.for_all.before(callable)
